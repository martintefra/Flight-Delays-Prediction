In this notebook, I develop 2 models for predicting flight delays at landing depending on airports and airlines.

The data for running this notebook can be found on this website: https://www.kaggle.com/code/fabiendaniel/predicting-flight-delays-tutorial/input.

I developped 2 models: 
- a simple one: linear regression)
- a more complex one: temporal graph neural network).
